# Machine Learning Pipeline API

## â–  Objective of the Task

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning pipeline that exposes model functionalities through an API. This allows seamless integration of ML predictions into real-world applications via HTTP endpoints. It aims to automate data preprocessing, prediction, and result serving.

## â–  Methodology / Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and transformed input data.
   - Applied necessary feature encoding and scaling techniques.
   
2. **Model Training**:
   - Selected a supervised learning algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
   - Trained the model on a labeled dataset and validated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.

3. **API Development**:
   - Built using Flask or FastAPI.
   - Created endpoints to accept input data, process it through the ML pipeline, and return predictions.
   - Used tools like `pickle` or `joblib` to serialize the trained model.

4. **Testing & Deployment**:
   - Unit and integration tests added to verify the API and model behavior.
   - Ready for deployment via platforms like Render, Heroku, or Docker containers.

## â–  Key Results or Observations

- âœ… The model achieved high accuracy (e.g., ~90%) on validation/test data.
- âœ… The API correctly handles both valid and invalid inputs with appropriate responses.
- âœ… Modular code design separates concerns (data handling, model logic, API routing).
- âœ… Easily extendable for additional models or preprocessing steps.
